I've made simple image which downloads and installs required tools to be able to clone git repository, and build image of the repository that was downloaded. Then built image is pushed to the Dockerhub. Before running the application with command: 'docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock "image-builder"' image-builder is built with 'docker build . -t image-builder'.
