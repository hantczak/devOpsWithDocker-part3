I've chosen of the applications that were given to us during course. It's name is spring-example-project. I've forked the repository, created Dockerfile, tested it locally and then created a heroku - deploy pipeline which automatically pushes app into heroku after commiting to "master" branch. It uses GitHub secrets to ensure privacy of the login credentials, app name and Heroku API key. Link to the repository: https://github.com/hantczak/spring-example-project
